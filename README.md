~~###CONTRIBUTING:~~

~~We're happy to accept pull requests! :)  ~~

~~Links are stored in the [_links](_links) folder, organized by directory into categories. These directories are for file organization, the actual categories and navigation are managed through the [_data/nav.yml](_data/nav.yml)
#&nbsp;
!!!Tags are not arbitrary!!!
Before submitting your pull request check out that you selected correct tag.  
For example:
tags: [Other,Social]  
places link into subsection called *Social*, in folder *Other*, 
which then displays in tab Social, under mentioned subsection, 
which has the same name. Every link in Other displays in tab Social.

~~To make this simple - when submitting, your tags are actually
name of first folder, and name of its subfolder.~~

~~No other tags should be used/written.~~
